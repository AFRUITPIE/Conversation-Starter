# Conversation Starter

Conversation Starter is an Android application designed for API level 19 and above. Conversation Starter allows those of us who are unsure of how to kick off conversations to simply select a contact from their saved contacts and send a friendly SMS chosen at random from a pre-built list of icebreakers.

Conversation Starter also allows the user to input their own starters and save them for later, as well as to specify an online repository of starters to pull from (in JSON format). 

For those particularly daring (or stupid) users, Conversation Starter also has an "Evil Mode". While in Evil Mode, Conversation Starter will choose from a list of uncouth icebreakers, pester those contacts who do not respond, and occasionally simply message the wrong person.
